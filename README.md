# Design and Analysis of Algorithms HW9 - Optimization algorithms

### Minimization of the Sphere function
* Hill Climbing - (best solution for 1000 iterations)
* Randomized Local Search - (need more iterations > 1 000 000 for Hill Climbing result)
* Simulated Annealing - (need more iterations > 2 000 000 for Hill Climbing result)
